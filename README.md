# AnimToTextureHelpers

These are two UASSETS for Unreal Engine 5.1 to help with using the AnimToTexture plugin.  This plugin will create vertex animation textures in Unreal Engine, taking a Skeletal Mesh and a set of animations and creating a static mesh and textures which will animate that static mesh.  This could be used to make a crowd, for example.


One UASSET is an Editor Utility Blueprint used to make vertex animation textures and related assets for bone based VAT motion.  The other UASSET is a blueprint for instancing a static mesh with vertex animation textures.  Copy these to your project content folder.  They work in Unreal Engine 5.1

These are offered as a demonstration or example only, no support or guarantee is offered.  Itâ€™s likely these would need modification for your use case.

NOTE: Clone the repo or download the files individually.  A user has noted that when using the "download zip" feature, the binary files get corrupted and won't be recognized in UE.
